# Unfinished-Playdate-Game-Excerpts
Code excerpts from the unfinished playdate game i worked on

I am not able to share the whole repo as the owner wishes to keep it private but I have been given permission to share code excerpts and some files to have here as part of my portfolio.

The game was a side scrolling shooter made for the Playdate (https://play.date/), i wrote all the code for the game including the player and enemy controllers, swappable weapons and code to interface with the Playdates Crank.
